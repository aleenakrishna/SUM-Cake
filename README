SUM Cake

I was tired of not having any good user management systems. I decided to build SUM Cake. 

Simple User Management for CakePHP is designed to allow anyone to quickly build an AUTH protected site in cake.

TODO:
- implement terms of service validation?
- system wide "block account" implementation (i.e. to deactivate account for payment failure)
- Groups. A user can belong to a group that can share items within the group.
