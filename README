SUM Cake

I was tired of not having any good user management systems. I decided to build Simple User Management - Cake.

Simple User Management for CakePHP, known as SUM-Cake is designed to allow anyone to quickly build an AUTH protected site in cake.

Features:
- includes permissions for App, App:build(), and Plugins
- global permissions
- permission overrides on the controller / app level
- uses CakePHP Auth component
- Simple to use / very basic but very powerful
- Limits data to users where user role = User

If you have an idea for a feature that would enhance this project, please drop me a line.

Happy Coding!
Chuck
